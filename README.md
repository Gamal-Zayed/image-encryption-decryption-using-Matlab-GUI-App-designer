# image-encryption-decryption-using-Matlab-GUI-App-designer
In this mini project, an image encryption and decryption using Matlab is implemented. The technique used for encryption is the blurring technique, where a Wiener filter is used to decrypt the blurred image. The mini project involves introductory pieces of Matlab codes that helps better understanding of image (pixel) value assignment.
