# image-encryption-decryption-using-Matlab-GUI-App-designer
In this mini project, an image encryption and decryption using Matlab is implemented. The technique used for encryption is the blurring technique, where a Wiener filter is used to decrypt the blurred image. The mini project involves introductory pieces of Matlab codes that helps better understanding of image (pixel) value assignment.

The first part overviews how to change the values of the image pixels. To do so, you need to:
1) open the matlab script named "Pixels_Assigning.m";
2) import the image "Cameraman.png". In this piece of code, we change the upper left pixel from grey into white.

The second part deals with glitches removal from an image. Use the matlab code named "Glitch_Averaging.m" to create a glitch then remove it using an averaging filter.

The third part applies the image blurring (as a simple encryption way), and de-blurring (for decryption). We need to use:
1) the file "Blurring_and_Deblurring.m";
2) the camera man again for this piece of code as an image sample.

The fourth and last part implements GUI using App designer. We need to:
1) open the file app3.mlapp;
2) import the image "Penguins.jpg";
3) import the imnage "DSP.jpg".

Thank you
I hope you enjoy it!
