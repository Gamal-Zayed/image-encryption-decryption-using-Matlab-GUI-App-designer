# image-encryption-decryption-using-Matlab-GUI-App-designer
In this mini project, an image encryption and decryption using Matlab is implemented. The technique used for encryption is the blurring technique, where a Wiener filter is used to decrypt the blurred image. The mini project involves introductory pieces of Matlab codes that helps better understanding of image (pixel) value assignment.

The first part overviews how to change the values of the image pixels. To do so, you need to open the matlab script named "Pixels_Assigning.m" and the image "Cameraman.png". In this piece of code, we change the upper left pixel from grey into white.
